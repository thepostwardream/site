From Subnets to Symbolism: A Tactical Evolution
Beginnings in Network Architecture
I started by reclaiming control of my digital environment through granular subnet masks, VLAN segmentation, and forensic modem/router auditing. Every consumer-grade limitation became a puzzle to solve—DHCP sniffers to detect rogue servers, custom NAT configurations for segmentation, and firmware integrity checks for trust. This phase laid the technical groundwork for everything that followed.

Expanding the Scope: Physical and RF Forensics
Next, I ventured beyond packets into physical infrastructure. I audited utility boxes, traced coax runs, and inspected service entrances for covert tampering. I deployed RF scanning tools to pinpoint interference and detect ultrasonic anomalies. My network wasn’t just wires and switches; it was a live case file.

Building the Behavioral Matrix
With technical insights secured, I mapped human factors. I tracked trust erosion, psychological contagion, and symbolic actors in community rituals. Timestamped social sentiment analysis of gig economy shifts and local nicknames fed into a dynamic matrix. Even car symbolism and meme culture became data points in my forensic narrative.

Legal Integration and Narrative Control
I formalized my evidence stream through open records requests, detailed legal documentation, and pretrial motions in Rocket Docket. Every audit, every sentiment graph, became part of a legal counter-script. This wasn’t just defense—it was proactive assertion of rights and reputation management against digital and cultural surveillance.

Synthesis: A Unified Forensic Toolkit
Today, my work sits at the intersection of network security, physical auditing, behavioral analysis, and legal strategy. GlassWire, Wireshark, RF scanners, symbolic taxonomy, and court filings coexist in one integrated threat matrix. My mission has evolved from troubleshooting to crafting a holistic framework for autonomy and dignity.
